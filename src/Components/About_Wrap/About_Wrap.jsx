              Erasmus Life Housing is your go-to hub for finding the perfect
              home for students, by students. Since 2025, our team has helped
              tons of students discover their ideal place. We’ve got a wide
              selection of student-friendly rooms, all built and managed just
              for you.

            <p>
              Our ultimate goal is to make Lisbon the number one destination for
              International Students and Young Workers, and we most surely don’t
              want that your experience finding accommodation to be a negative
              point of that experience!
